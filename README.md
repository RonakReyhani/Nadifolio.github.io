My very first attempt to create a workfolio 

issues I am aware of and keep woring on it:
- in mobile collapse menue stays open and not closed with re-click on kebab menu.
- Main page title banner is so big in desktop , it's a SVG I need to figure out hoe to make it smaller however in mobile view it looks fine.
- I tired to make an embedded page (iframe) in main page-home page with help of Scrollspy but it only shows a plain content with an ugly menu on top.
what I tried to impliment was something like this:
https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/docs/4.0/bootstrap-components/scrollspy/#example-in-navbar

- Carousel has a delay to run the slides and resizes when swapes to show a new slide , also in small devices carousel is bigger than cards , I have to change that element to a normal card when screen is to small!

- Contact form in portraitÂ view stays on top of the page and in Desktop view is so huge as I tried to make the from block bigger 
- social icons in Ipad view stickes very close to the last element instead of body-bottom! 

I am pretty sure you will find even more
